# ps-package-manager
PeopleSoft Package Manager (PS to GitHub Integration)

Project Charter:

Create a seamless connection between a customer’s development environment and GitHub, for both easy download of existing free projects (such as Process Monitor 2.0) and “work in process” projects (efforts to collaborate on new bolt-on code, interactively).

***************************************************************************
Files:

Z_PSPM_PACKAGE_MANAGER_v0.1.zip - Contains first draft of Setup page, for Package Manager.

***************************************************************************
Phases:

There are two phases to this initiative:

Phase 1:  GitHub Package Manager page where customers can review, install and receive updates for GitHub projects.

Phase 2:  Collaboration space for community-driven bolt-on projects.

***************************************************************************
Special Note on this repository:

The GitHub repository "ps-package-manager" is focused on phase 1.
***************************************************************************

Phase 1 - For existing projects, allow an effortless “package manager” to:

Find projects that are in beta testing or ready for prime time.  The listing of projects would be in a customer’s own development environment.

Allow the customer to do “1-click” installations, from the page that lists all of the available GitHub projects.

Allow the customer to see installed projects, and any updates pending.

Allow the customer to do “1-click” upgrades, to existing projects.

Provide a compare report of what changes would be introduced, if a new project (or an update) were installed.

Provide an information sheet on what each project can provide.  Possibly have screenshots.

Provide the instructions for migration to test and production.

***************************************************************************

Phase 2 - For Collaboration Projects:

Allow a customer to sign up for new or on-going projects being run by a community member.

Allow the customer to download any existing code as a starting point.

Allow the customer to add or modify code/objects, and submit them back to GitHub for community review or pull request.

Allow comments to be added to any submitted code, for both context and documentation purposes.

Track all contributors to a project.  Allow the contributor to not be listed as an official contributor.
