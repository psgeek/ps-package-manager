# ps-package-manager
PeopleSoft Package Manager (PS to GitHub Integration)

Project Charter:

Create a seamless connection between a customer’s development environment and GitHub, for both easy download of existing free projects (such as Process Monitor 2.0) and “work in process” projects (efforts to collaborate on new bolt-on code, interactively).

Phases
There are two phases to this initiative:
•	Phase 1:  GitHub Package Manager page where customers can review, install and receive updates for GitHub projects.
•	Phase 2:  Collaboration space for community-driven bolt-on projects.

***************************************************************************
Special Note on this repository:

The GitHub repository "ps-package-manager" is focused on phase 1.
***************************************************************************

Phase 1 - For existing projects, allow an effortless “package manager” to:
•	Find projects that are in beta testing or ready for prime time.  The listing of projects would be in a customer’s own development environment.
•	Allow the customer to do “1-click” installations, from the page that lists all of the available GitHub projects.
•	Allow the customer to see installed projects, and any updates pending.
•	Allow the customer to do “1-click” upgrades, to existing projects.
•	Provide a compare report of what changes would be introduced, if a new project (or an update) were installed.
•	Provide an information sheet on what each project can provide.  Possibly have screenshots.
•	Provide the instructions for migration to test and production.

Phase 2 - For Collaboration Projects:
•	Allow a customer to sign up for new or on-going projects being run by a community member.
•	Allow the customer to download any existing code as a starting point.
•	Allow the customer to add or modify code/objects, and submit them back to GitHub for community review or pull request.
•	Allow comments to be added to any submitted code, for both context and documentation purposes.
•	Track all contributors to a project.  Allow the contributor to not be listed as an official contributor.
