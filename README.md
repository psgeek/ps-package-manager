# PeopleSoft Package Manager (PeopleSoft/GitHub Integration)
## Project Charter
Create a seamless connection between a customer’s development environment and GitHub, for both easy downloading of existing free projects (such as Process Monitor 2.0) and “work in process” projects (efforts to collaborate on new bolt-on code, interactively).
***
## Files
* Z_PSPM_PACKAGE_MANAGER_v0.x.zip - Contains latest code.  Until the release is version 1, it is only partially operable.
* [Screenshots folder](/screenshots/) - Examples of pages from PeopleSoft.
## Phases
There are two phases to this initiative:
* Phase 1:  GitHub Package Manager page where customers can review, install and receive updates for GitHub projects.  (GitHub --> PeopleSoft)
* Phase 2:  Collaboration space for community-driven bolt-on projects.  (GitHub <--> PeopleSoft)
***
### Special Note on this repository
The GitHub repository "ps-package-manager" is focused on phase 1.
***
### Phase 1
Design an effortless **package manager**
* Find projects that are in beta testing or ready for prime time.  The listing of projects would be in a customer’s own development environment.
* Allow the customer to do “1-click” installations, from the page that lists all of the available GitHub projects.
* Allow the customer to see installed projects, and any updates pending.
* Allow the customer to do “1-click” upgrades, to existing projects.
* Provide a compare report of what changes would be introduced, if a new project (or an update) were installed.
* Provide an information sheet on what each project can provide.  Possibly have screenshots.
* Provide the instructions for migration to test and production.

### Phase 2
Collaboration on GitHub Projects (Repositories)
* Allow a customer to sign up for new or on-going projects being run by a community member.
* Allow the customer to download any existing code as a starting point.
* Allow the customer to add or modify code/objects, and submit them back to GitHub for community review or pull request.
* Allow comments to be added to any submitted code, for both context and documentation purposes.
* Track all contributors to a project.  Allow the contributor to not be listed as an official contributor.
