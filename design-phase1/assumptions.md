# Assumptions

The following are assumptions for this initiative (PS/GitHub Integration):
* The initiative will be stored on GitHub.
* The initiative is free and open source.
* The list of downloadable projects will also be GitHub projects.  Code will reside on each respective owner’s GitHub folder.  In the event that customers cannot access GitHub, and with proper permissions from other GitHub customers, mirrored copies of the code might reside on a third-party server.
* Projects on the Package Manager page will be free and open source.  Projects must reside under an MIT license.  No single contributor or customer owns the code; it is owned by the community.  If an employee contributes by sending code back to GitHub, the employer they work for has no rights on the code being submitted.  Likewise, the employer has full rights to use the GitHub code with no royalties or fees being paid to GitHub or the community.
* Extra data, screenshots, etc will either reside on each respective GitHub folder, or on this initiative’s GitHub folder.
* Project pushes to a customer are only intended for Development environments.  It is the responsibility for each customer to review and test the code, before migrating to Test and Production.
