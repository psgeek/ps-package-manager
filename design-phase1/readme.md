# Design For Phase 1
### Quick Definitions
* The term *App Designer* represents PeopleTools' *Application Designer*.
* The term *project* might represent an App Designer *project*, or a GitHub *Repository*.
* The term *PackMan* is short for this repository: *PeopleSoft Package Manager*.
* The term *host system* represents the *PeopleSoft development environment* that PackMan is running in.
### Actions
* Load the list of available GitHut App Designer projects, when the PackMan page first loads.
* Allow a compare for any project listed on the PackMan page.
* Allow a project to be installed.
### Tasks
Some of these tasks will be combined together to form a single action (for the list above).  **Group** represents the priority/order needed for the project, though different people can work ahead on Group 2 or 3.
* [ ] Get List of all active/approved GitHub App Designer projects, for possible download. **Group 2**
