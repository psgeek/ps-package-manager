# Extra Ideas
Ideas To Kick Around:
*	Have a flag that states if this is a pure-bolt on, or if it touches any delivered objects.
*	Each project from GitHub will have a minimal Tools version and maybe certain Apps, App release/PUM Release.
*	Have the page allow the users to subscribe to different github spaces? For instance, if you have a particular format that is required, and a developer (who has his own github page) conforms to your standards, can the page allow the end user to say... add/watch this github space?  I guess this is kinda like your marketplace idea... in a different way
*	Verification process on the Package Manager page.  That way projects have been vetted for no malicious code, by a gatekeeper or the community, or a group of trusted developers.
